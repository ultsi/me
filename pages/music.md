I'm trying to collect everything I find interesting in music here. Check it out!

### Profiles:  
* ![icon](/assets/images/logos/spotify.png)[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/ultsii)
* ![icon](/assets/images/logos/lastfm.png)[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/ulmanen)

### Music:

#### Minimalistic pieces:
* [Dawn of midi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH4lkK-vSco)
* [Y2KX Loopfest - Polymetric counterpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_TphYCggqg) one of my favorite pieces studying and most of all showing polymetric composing visually.
* [Nik BÃ¤rtsch's Ronin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3vto4IZN8) unfortunately not many of their songs are on the internet, but definitely a long time favorite artist of mine.
