### Music:

#### Minimalistic pieces:
* [Dawn of midi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH4lkK-vSco)
* [Y2KX Loopfest - Polymetric counterpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_TphYCggqg) one of my favorite pieces studying and most of all showing polymetric composing visually.
* [Nik BÃ¤rtsch's Ronin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3vto4IZN8) unfortunately not many of their songs are on the internet, but definitely a long time favorite artist of mine.
* [Avishai Cohen - Caravan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsum9ortSFc) awesome take on the piece
* [Half Life - Suit song (song 23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgocIvDC_z8) emotional part in the game
* [Avishai Cohen Trio - Pinzin Kinzin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6KYbpDditU) whole "Gently Disturbed" album is quite nice, and this is one of my favorite pieces from the album.
