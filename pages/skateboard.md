## Articles

I've found Jenkem Magazine's article A Skateboarder's Intro To Yoga to be really helpful before sessions. You can read it here: [A Skateboarder's Intro To Yoga](http://www.jenkemmag.com/home/2016/12/29/a-skateboarders-intro-to-yoga/)

## Me

I've uploaded a few videos to my vimeo account: [https://vimeo.com/user68647378](https://vimeo.com/user68647378)

## Videos

This is a list for myself of good skateboarding videos in no particular order.

*   [Louie Barletta - Bag of suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tD9hWKSgN8)  
    Absolutely one of my favorites, showing the fun and creative side of skateboarding. Killer soundtrack, too. Includes also famous Finnish spots like Pasila kink (rip).

*   [Brandon Westgate - MADE](http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/classics-brandon-westgate-s-made-part/)  
    King of pop. One of the best soundtracks in skateboarding for sure.

*   [Ambition Snowskates - SAVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOY3IkjZb1Q)  
    This gets me hyped up to go snowskate. Waiting for the new video Solstice!  

*   [David Engerer - Let's play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0pfwb9a4wI)  
    Favorite snowskater. Perfect soundtrack, goes fast.

*   [Samu Karvonen - Where we're from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXMC4FhnOLI).  
    Favorite Finnish skateboarder. Classic Finnish scenery, spots and unbelievable ender. Having been at the actual spot I can't believe it.

*   [Sebo Walker - Krooked LSD part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCBVdrPFqXI)  
	New favorite of mine

*	[Eniz Fazliov - SLP Turso](http://www.freeskatemag.com/2018/01/29/eniz-fazliov-in-slps-turso/)  
	Holy shit. Same ender spot as in Samu Karvonen's part above, but much faster speed. Some of the best Finnish skating I've seen.
