I added these two new articles to my list of articles:  
* [DRM's Dead Canary: How We Just Lost the Web, What We Learned from It, and What We Need to Do Next](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/drms-dead-canary-how-we-just-lost-web-what-we-learned-it-and-what-we-need-do-next)
* [Against an increasingly user-hostile web](www.neustadt.fr/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web)

I have seen more and more of these articles which speak about open internet's demise. I originally deleted my Facebook account because of its shady tactics to steal users' attention, but now I've started to delete my accounts from other services like Instagram and Linkedin which are not open to the whole world (i.e. you need an account to see the content). Also I'm trying more and more to separate Google from my life - I switched to use Firefox and Duckduckgo already.

I think the harm is, that these services' effect on networking is **huge**. It's already common and accepted to 'stalk' acquiantances on Facebook or Instagram to learn more about them. If I don't exist on these services, I don't give a chance to the possibility <sup>[1]</sup> of being discovered by a potential employer for example.

Well, I think I just need to leave dummy accounts redirecting to this site.
