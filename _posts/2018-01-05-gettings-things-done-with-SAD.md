Everyone in Finland has to cope with *kaamosmasennus* - seasonal affective disorder (SAD) during the winter. I think it is worse in southern parts of Finland where there is no snow for most part of the year. At least it feels like it after living in winter wonderland called Kuopio for 19 years before moving to Helsinki.

## Lighting

First of all, I think the special lamps designed to help with SAD are a marketing hoax. I remember we had one when I was a kid. It hurt my eyes more than it helped cope with the everlasting darkness. The lamps were this kind:

So a good friend of mine introduced me to this article in December: [Surviving seasonal depression with MORE LUX](https://meaningness.com/metablog/sad-light-led-lux). I got inspired and turned all my lights on in my room and from since I have been keeping them on until I want to get ready for sleep. The difference was huge. I remember that I used to fall asleep in the middle of studying in November. Now it's been easier to keep awake to keep doing whatever I want and I feel tired more rarely. I didn't even have to buy the headlights designed for SUVs recommended in the article to get rid of SAD. 

So more light = less SAD.

## Outdoor hobbies

Second tip on how to feel good during the dark time of the year: get yourself an outdoor hobby. I myself hated winter before finding the hobby of [snowskating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOY3IkjZb1Q). After a few years, I have found myself longing for winter. It definitely helps to cope with the season, if you have a season-dependent hobby.
