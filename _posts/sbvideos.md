This is a list for myself of good skateboarding videos. Maybe it's useful to you too!

*   [Louie Barletta - Bag of suck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tD9hWKSgN8)  
    Absolutely one of my favorites, showing the fun and creative side of skateboarding. Killer soundtrack, too.

*   [Brandon Westgate - MADE](http://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/classics-brandon-westgate-s-made-part/)  
    King of pop. One of the best soundtracks in skateboarding for sure.

*   [Ambition Snowskates - SAVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOY3IkjZb1Q)  
    This gets me hyped up to go snowskate. Waiting for the new video Solstice!  

*   [David Engerer - Let's play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0pfwb9a4wI)  
    Favorite snowskater. Perfect soundtrack, goes fast.
