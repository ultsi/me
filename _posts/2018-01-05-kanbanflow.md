After years of searching, after using Trello, git, Meistertask, I found the best task managing application for personal life. It's called Kanbanflow. This post describes why it works for me and how I use it.

## What is Kanbanflow

*My example Kanbanflow board*

If you have ever used Trello or any other task management software, Kanbanflow will be immediately familiar to you. If you haven't, well, you can take a look at the Wikipedia article on [task management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_management). It's primary feature is to help you to manage your tasks more efficiently. Some people like to describe the software as *todo list software*.

## Why choose Kanbanflow over others?

### Simplicity

For me, Kanbanflow's main selling point is its simplicity and in that, its use of colors. If you take a look at a Trello board or a Meistertask board, you can't get a clear view of the whole picture easily, or at least I can't. Trello (in the middle) is the worst of these - every task looks practically the same and task coloring is shown by using little lines. Meistertask (on the left) does a little better by coloring the columns, urgent tasks and graying out tasks that are done. None of them still achieve the simplicity of Kanbanflow, where you can get clear picture of the tasks very quickly.

### Integrated pomodoro timer

This is a huge one. The timer can be seen in the images on bottom left. It follows the pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of work and a 5 minute break, repeat 4 times and get a 15 minute break. The timer is super simple to use and you can even select a task where the time will automatically log to. Using pomodoro has been key for me when studying for example, and this hits my time tracking nerve at the same time!

### Recurring tasks

This is a simple one but a feature that I feel has been missing from other boards, or it has been hard to use. Recurring tasks is a simple way to form habits and to keep them up. I use recurring tasks to remind me to write my diary (just started writing it) or remind me to play piano for at least 25 min a day.

## How I use it

My life practically follows my Kanbanflow board. I've divided the board into 11 columns, of which 6 are more visionary columns: **Bucketlist**, **Goals 2018** and rest 4 are quarterly goals. Remaining five columns I've named **To-do**, **This week**, **Tomorrow**, **Today** and the final one is, of course, **Done**.

This board setup reads naturally from left to right, with the more visionary tasks first setting a theme or rather a guideline for the tasks on the left. This way I can keep my bucketlist and goals for the year in mind when I'm adding new tasks.

*To-do, this week, tomorrow, today* setup is more focused on real tasks and divided in time estimates that are quick to understand. Every evening I spend 5 minutes organising the tasks so that *today* column is empty and *tomorrow* column contains all the tasks I want to complete on the next day. That way I can get rid of the "I should do this tomorrow" thoughts before bedtime and clear my head. Every now and then, I reconsider my week and add things from the *todo* column to *this week* or *tomorrow* column.

There is no perfect time managing software that fits everyone. Nevertheless, Kanbanflow has struck a specific nerve with me and I think it'll take years before I change to something else. If you have questions, email me!
